# TurtleBot3 Basic Examples with ROS2 on Real Robot

This project demonstrates the implementation of several **TurtleBot3 basic examples**, including **SLAM**, using **real TurtleBot3 Burger hardware** with **ROS2 (Humble)** on **Ubuntu 22.04**. All examples are based on the official [TurtleBot3 e-Manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/basic_examples/#basic-examples) and were executed on the physical robot (not simulation).

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Learn and apply basic robotic functionalities using TurtleBot3
- Work directly with ROS2 and real robot hardware
- Demonstrate mapping, navigation, and multi-robot coordination
- Build hands-on experience with mobile robot systems

## 👨‍💻 Team Members

- **Shivanshu Vishwakarma**
- **Anish Deep Toppo**

## 📘 Examples Implemented

The following official TurtleBot3 examples were successfully implemented and tested on real TurtleBot3 robots:

- 🔹 Move Using Interactive Markers  
- 🔹 Obstacle Detection  
- 🔹 Point Operation  
- 🔹 Patrol  
- 🔹 Load Multiple TurtleBot3  
- 🔹 SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

### 🔸 Move Using Interactive Markers  
The robot is controlled using RViz's interactive markers, allowing the user to send movement goals by simply dragging markers in a graphical interface.

### 🔸 Obstacle Detection  
The robot detects obstacles using LiDAR and stops or navigates accordingly, demonstrating basic reactive behavior.

### 🔸 Point Operation  
The robot is sent to specific goal coordinates using ROS2 navigation commands and successfully reaches them.

### 🔸 Patrol  
The TurtleBot3 follows a predefined set of waypoints in a loop, simulating patrol behavior for surveillance or exploration tasks.

### 🔸 Load Multiple TurtleBot3  
Two TurtleBot3 robots are operated simultaneously, demonstrating multi-robot coordination in a shared space.

### 🔸 SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)  
Using SLAM, the TurtleBot3 builds a real-time map of its environment while localizing itself within that map using LiDAR and odometry data.
